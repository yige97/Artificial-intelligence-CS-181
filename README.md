# Artificial-intelligence-CS-181
These are projects based on the course artificial intelligence, named the Pac-Man projects. They apply an array of AI techniques to playing Pac-Man.

# P1
Implement depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms, these algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.  
# P2
Classic Pacman is modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem. Implement multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions.
