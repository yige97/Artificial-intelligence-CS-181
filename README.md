# Artificial-intelligence-CS-181
These are projects based on the course artificial intelligence, named the Pac-Man projects. They apply an array of AI techniques to playing Pac-Man.

# P1
Implement depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms, these algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.  
# P2
Classic Pacman is modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem. Implement multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions.
# p3
Using logic expression to handle the planning problem.
# p4
Construct a Bayes net structure and apply it in the inference of the pacman. Implement the inference by variable elimination implementation.
# p5
Implement a pac-man agent's action that can charges the ghost, by using forward algorithm updates to compute the exact belief function, and using a particle filter for approximately tracking a single ghost.
# p6
Implement Q-learning pac-man agent's action, also implement a value iteration pac-man agents that take a Markov decision process on initialization and run value iteration (or cyclic value iteration, or prioritized sweeping value iteration).
